# Report Theme
This folder contains the theme file used in the sample report.
The purpose of the theme is to apply global style guidelines to the report standardizing a color pallete, fonts, objects borders, and backgrounds among other configurations. As a result, all the visuals used in the report will inherit the styling attributes defined in the theme.

## About the theme
The visual properties of most of the visuals can be modified by defining a style tied to the type (e.g. slicer, card, or textbox) in the JSON file. Have in mind that, even though most properties can be defined, some of them are not. Refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-report-themes) for the details.
