# Comparison Chart
This custom visual was created to compare tennis stats between two different players. Stat values are represented by bar charts and disposed in a mirrored layout to facilitate the comparison.

## Considerations
- The *Category* section should have only one field
- The *Measure* sections will be shown one per row (values and bar charts)
- There is a *Multipliers* section that can help to adjust the values to a proper visual scale.

## Development setup
To update or debug the custom visual, refer to the [custom visuals documentation](../README.md) and follow the instructions to set up the development environment.
